<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">palace, with every window-pane ablaze in the fierce sun of June.</p><p>Around the fountain, children and white-capped nurses armed with bamboo poles were pushing toy boats, whose sails hung limp in the sunshine. A dark policeman, wearing red epaulettes and a dress sword, watched them for a while and then went away to remonstrate with a young man who had unchained his dog. The dog was pleasantly occupied in rubbing grass and dirt into his back while his legs waved into the air.</p><p>The policeman pointed at the dog. He was speechless with indignation.</p><p>"Well, Captain," smiled the young fellow.</p><p>"Well, Monsieur Student," growled the policeman.</p><p>"What do you come and complain to me for?"</p><p>"If you don't chain him I'll take him," shouted the policeman.</p><p>"What's that to me, mon capitaine?"</p></div> </div>
