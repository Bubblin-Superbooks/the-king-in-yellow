On the pink cotton inside lay a clasp of black onyx, on which was inlaid a curious symbol or letter in gold. It was neither Arabic nor Chinese, nor, as I found afterwards, did it belong to any human script.</p><p>"It's all I had to give you for a keepsake," she said timidly.</p><p>I was annoyed, but I told her how much I should prize it, and promised to wear it always. She fastened it on my coat beneath the lapel.</p><p>"How foolish, Tess, to go and buy me such a beautiful thing as this," I said.</p><p>"I did not buy it," she laughed.</p><p>"Where did you get it?"</p></div> </div>
